ProxyToggle
===========

This extension adds a button to your toolbar that toggles the localhost proxy 
on and off. Just drag the .xpi file into Firefox and click Install when
the dialog appears.

After you have set up manual proxy configuration, ProxyToggle will switch
between system and manual proxy settings. 

You can also use the keyboard shortcut ctrl-alt-T instead of clicking the
toolbar button.
